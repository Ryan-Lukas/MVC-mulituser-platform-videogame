CS 3500 - Software Practice - Fall 2018

*C#*

Background
------------
Real-time distributed multiuser platform - designed, developed, and deployed a modular software framework for a distributed multiuser platform.

This assignment we created a multiplayer game simular to astroids but allowed multiple individuals connect to the client and play against each other. I learned the MVC design pattern within CS 3500 and implemented it within this project. I also learned about networking and using sockets to connect and disconnect players. 

*NOTE: This project must have a server to run on and during this project, we used our school server that our professor set up.*
